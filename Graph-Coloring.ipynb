    "Part 1 of the project is used to create different conflict graphs. Conflict graphs represent realworld problems. For example, one may be thought of as a set of vertices representing courses that students may take. An edge is present between two vertices (courses) in the graph if a student is taking both courses. This edge indicates they may not be scheduled at the same time.<br/>\n",
    "Once the graph is colored, the color of each vertex represents its timeslot and the total number of colors would represent the total number of required timeslots for that coloring.<br/>\n",
    "The vertices which have a conflict in this project will be determined based on graph types and a random number generator with different distributions."
